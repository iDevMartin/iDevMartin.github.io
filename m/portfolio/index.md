<h2><small style="color:#797979;">2014</small>  Arendelle Language</h2>
[Website](http://web.arendelle.org) | [Developer Website](http://web.arendelle.org/developer/) | [GitHub Repositories](http://github.com/arendelle)<br>
Arendelle is a domain-specific programming language for creating 16-bit like Pixel art. Arendelle uses a grid system and a pointer for navigating and painting the desired squares of the grid. The grammar behind Arendelle is completely new as it uses only one character for it's commands and grammars. Just like everything else in Arendelle the main engine of the language is based on a new interpreter design invented by Pouya Kary named *Recursive Scanner* rather than the Lexer-Parser-Code-Generator. Using this technique the interpreter actually never generates any code. It reads the code and execute it. Like a byte-code runtime but much more powerful to understand grammars. This way for executing makes the software much more fast and efficient<br><br>

<h2><small style="color:#797979;">2015</small>  HeatStudio</h2>
[Website](http://www.heatstudio.org) | [GitHub Repositories](http://github.com/heatstudio)<br>
HeatStudio is a the most advanced software for computing the Heat Transfer Coefficient in buildings supporting adjacency detection for adjacent surfaces and calculation Tau parameter for those zones. Developed for the Iran National Building and Housing Research Center Department of Energy and Environmental Design (BHRC Energy Lab for short) to be the official software for the National Building Regulation Code 19. The software introduces a SketchUp plugin as it's front-end editor and a NREL OpenStudio powered back-end. It calculates the total Building Heat Transfer Coefficient based on the algorithms for real heat transfer coefficient calculation and the Code19's own algorithm for the same parameter and then visualizes the result based on a rich detailed UI as well as a visualization on the SketchUp model itself showing the efficiency of thermal zones using colors. HeatStudio also has a built in editor and computation engine for thermal bridges which is not found in any other software.<br><br>
